Programming Question 1
======================
To create the BruteForce I used external variable to keep the track of the minimum distance
and the array of cities that give the order.
Almost all the time my BruteForce give 2 mm seconds to perform
and Nearest Neighbor always give almost 0 seconds to perform
However, not all the time NN find the shortest route, but  the difference between NN and BF wasn't big neither
