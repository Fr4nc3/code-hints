Programming Question 1
======================
FindPalindromes class
its main method receive the name of the file as parameter
this works only if the file is in the same directory of the class
I created my own stack and used in addition of the book and the lectures
I used as example http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaDatastructures/article.html
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709128/how-to-create-an-array-arraylist-stack-and-queue-in-java
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDjrM6-iiw
First I was inverting the string with the stack but later I changed
to compare  Stack First In Last Out with each character of the original string
I clean the original string from characters with a regex [^\w]

I include the file palindromes.txt just in case! 

Programming Question 2
======================
TwoStackQueue was created with the help the follow articles
http://www.minich.com/education/wyo/java/lecture_notes/big%20oh%20chart.php
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10562205/sorting-a-queue-with-another-queue
http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/13stacks/
Because I used the stack that I created in MyStack which used a linkedlist
give me a very good (I believe) performance for my code.
