Problem 1
=========
- Rectangle class
  - Implement comparable
- Problem1 class
 - has two arrays to test the findMax method
 - one array was created hard code rectangles
 - second array was created with rectangles with random width and length.
 - random dimension number goes between 1 to 50

Problem 2
=========
- uses Rectangle class from Problem 1
- test with an array  created with rectangles with random width and length.
- BinarySearch was convert from book example to recursive
- one rectangle to used to find was explicitly created in the array
- other test rectangle was created randomly and may or may not appear in the array
 - random dimension number goes between 1 to 50 too


Problem 3
=========
- Used  System.nanoTime() instead of System.currentTimeMillis() as it was suggested
- Used N = 10^n  where n goes 1 to 9
- Numbers for the benchmark can be not representative for the writing #3 because
 JAVA optimize the method. (see longer answer in Problem3.txt)
