# Given a matrix of integers, we'd like to consider the sum of the elements within the area of a 45Â°
# rotated rectangle. More formally, the area is bounded by two diagonals parallel to the main diagonal 
# and two diagonals parallel to the secondary diagonal. The dimensions of the rotated rectangle are defined 
# by the number of elements along the borders of the rectangle.


# Given integers a and b representing the dimensions of the rotated rectangle, 
# and matrix (a matrix of integers), your task is to find the greatest sum of integers 
# contained within an a x b rotated rectangle.

# Note: The order of the dimensions is not important - consider all a x b and b x a rectangles.

# Example
# a = 2, and b = 3, the output should be solution(matrix, a, b) = 36.
# For

# matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 0],
#           [5, 6, 7, 8, 1],
#           [3, 2, 4, 1, 4],
#           [4, 3, 5, 1, 6]]
