# Example 1:

# Input: arr = [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: You need three jumps from index 0 --> 4 --> 3 --> 9. Note that index 9 is the last index of the array.
# Example 2:

# Input: arr = [7]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Start index is the last index. You do not need to jump.
# Example 3:

# Input: arr = [7,6,9,6,9,6,9,7]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: You can jump directly from index 0 to index 7 which is last index of the array.
