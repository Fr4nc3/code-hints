# You are given two arrays of integers a and b of the same length, and an integer k. We will be iterating through array a from left to right, and simultaneously through array b from right to left, and looking at pairs (x, y), where x is from a and y is from b. Such a pair is called tiny if the concatenation xy is strictly less than k.

# Your task is to return the number of tiny pairs that you'll encounter during the simultaneous iteration through a and b.

# Example

# For a = [1, 2, 3], b = [1, 2, 3], and k = 31, the output should be
# solution(a, b, k) = 2.

# We're considering the following pairs during iteration:

# (1, 3). Their concatenation equals 13, which is less than 31, so the pair is tiny;
# (2, 2). Their concatenation equals 22, which is less than 31, so the pair is tiny;
# (3, 1). Their concatenation equals 31, which is not less than 31, so the pair is not tiny.
# As you can see, there are 2 tiny pairs during the iteration, so the answer is 2.

# For a = [16, 1, 4, 2, 14], b = [7, 11, 2, 0, 15], and k = 743, the output should be
# solution(a, b, k) = 4.

# We're considering the following pairs during iteration:

# (16, 15). Their concatenation equals 1615, which is greater than 743, so the pair is not tiny;
# (1, 0). Their concatenation equals 10, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny;
# (4, 2). Their concatenation equals 42, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny.
# (2, 11). Their concatenation equals 211, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny;
# (14, 7). Their concatenation equals 147, which is less than 743, so the pair is tiny.
# There are 4 tiny pairs during the iteration, so the answer is 4.
