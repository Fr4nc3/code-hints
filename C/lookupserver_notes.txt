======
I added ulimit -u 256 

a)
mkfifo mypipe
cat mypipe | nc -l <port #> | mdb-lookup > mypipe
from 

# add +x executable permission to the file if it doesn't have it 
#chmod a+x mdb-lookup-server-nc.sh


b)
ps ajxfww



the files that are shell scripts:
 /bin/sh ./mdb-lookup-server-nc.sh

c)
I used as reference to kill children process 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13273836/how-to-kill-child-of-fork
I didn't do port error when it is denied because it doesn't break my code 
for example


port number: 80
[pid=20532] mdb-lookup-server started on port 80
nc: Permission denied



and if the user enter ENTER 
can enter a valid port or enter number until it a valid port
